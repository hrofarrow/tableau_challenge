Story Included: 
  1. Citi Bike Analysis Phenomena
  
Phenomena Discovered: 
  1. The overall customer count decreased from 2013 to 2014 and then significantly increased again in 2015. This could do to increase in advertisement around the city or promotions created to bring in new customers. 
  2. The average customer identifies as male. This data may have been collected before the program increased incentives and advertisements to bring in more of the female population. If the same analysis was done in later years, we may see an increase in the female customers demographic. 
  3. The average customer is between the ages of 20 and 30. More information would need to be collected to determine if this age group coincides with the average overall population for the area or if it has to do with athleticism in the the younger age group. 
  4. The age group with the longest trip duration time is the age group from 80 - 90. This could be because the age group is not as athletic or agile as someone in the younger age groups but more information would be needed to prove this observation. 
  5. According to the data collected from September for 3 consecutive years, the peak start time for riders is around 8am and 5pm (when most individuals are leaving for work and leaving work). 
  6. Also the peak end time is about on hour after the peak start time, which coincides with about how long it would take to reach a station near the customers home/ work. 
  6. The most used bike for this month is 20590 with a count of 11. If we knew more about the location of businesses in this area, we may be able to determine why this particular bike is most popular. If we consider the use Monday through Friday during typical work hours, it could coincide with the same person having a favorite bike to travel to and from work with. More information would be needed to confirm this observation. 
  7. On average, the start and stop stations are used about 300 times per month. If more information was known about the particular locations of the stations, conclusions could be made to determine why some locations are used more than others.
